# AI English Dictionary - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

We've built a macOS application that provides AI-powered English dictionary functionality. The application allows users to look up words and get English explanations, mark unknown words in definitions, and access the dictionary globally through a keyboard shortcut.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Main Application**
   - `AIDictionaryApp.swift`: The main app entry point with menu bar integration
   - `ContentView.swift`: The primary search interface with word definition display
   - `Models.swift`: Data models for words and the word store

2. **API Integration**
   - `APIService.swift`: Service for communicating with DeepSeek Chat API
   - Support for avoiding specific words in definitions
   - Offline/mock mode for development

3. **Dictionary Features**
   - Word definition generation with AI
   - Interactive word marking in definitions
   - Definition regeneration with simpler vocabulary

4. **User Interface**
   - Main window with sidebar navigation
   - Menu bar quick access
   - Floating window for global lookups
   - Dark/light mode support
   - Customizable preferences

5. **Vocabulary Management**
   - Favorites system
   - Vocabulary list
   - Search history
   - Export functionality

### Key Files

- `AIDictionaryApp.swift`: Main application entry point
- `ContentView.swift`: Primary user interface
- `Models.swift`: Data structures and storage
- `APIService.swift`: DeepSeek Chat API integration
- `SupportingViews.swift`: Additional UI components
- `MenuBarView.swift`: Menu bar interface
- `PreferencesView.swift`: User settings
- `FloatingWindowService.swift`: Global text selection feature

### Verification

All requirements from the feature.md file have been implemented and marked as complete:

1. ✅ AI-generated word explanations
2. ✅ Smart vocabulary filtering
3. ✅ Global text selection and lookup
4. ✅ System performance requirements
5. ✅ UI/UX requirements

## Usage Instructions

The application can be built and run using Xcode. Users will need to:

1. Obtain a DeepSeek Chat API key
2. Configure the key in the app preferences
3. Use the search interface or Command+D global shortcut to look up words

Full testing procedures are documented in TESTING.md.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

1. Better offline mode with a larger local dictionary
2. Pronunciation guides and audio
3. Thesaurus functionality
4. Spaced repetition for vocabulary learning
5. API provider options beyond DeepSeek
