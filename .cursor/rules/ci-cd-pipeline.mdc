# CI/CD Pipeline

## Jenkins Pipeline
The project uses Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline is defined in [Jenkinsfile](mdc:Jenkinsfile).

### Pipeline Stages
1. Build and Test
   - Builds both macOS app and server
   - Runs unit tests
   - Generates test reports

2. Code Quality
   - Runs linting
   - Performs code coverage analysis
   - Generates coverage reports

3. Deployment
   - Deploys server to staging/production
   - Builds and signs macOS app
   - Creates release artifacts

## Fastlane (macOS App)
The macOS app uses Fastlane for automated deployment:
- [fastlane/](mdc:ai-dic-mac/fastlane/) contains the configuration
- Handles app signing and distribution
- Manages App Store submissions

## Docker (Server)
The server uses Docker for containerization:
- [docker-compose.yml](mdc:ai-dic-server/docker-compose.yml) defines the environment
- Ensures consistent development and production environments
- Simplifies deployment process
